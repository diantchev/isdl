Messaging provides the base mechanism for IPC employed by isdl framework. It is based on the following model: a process called msgdispatcher works as a mediator between the comunicating process. One of msgdispatcher should be started on every machine that is part of the comunicating network. If two processes need to send messages to each other on the same machine they will establish shared memory queue with the message dispatcher process. Message dispatcher process will route the message from the output queue of the produce process to the input queue of consumer process. If the comunication needs to be established between process on different machines producer will queue the message in its shared memory output queue to the dispatcher process on the local machine dispatcher will send the message through udp/tcp channel to consumers host dispatcher process. Consumer dispatcher process will then queue the message in the shared memory input queue for of the receiver process.
